It was a \"ghost town\" when I first arrived, but that didn\\'t bother me because the rent was low and I desperately needed a place to bake for my growing wholesale business. I hadn\\'t considered the retail aspects of the business until people started knocking on the door of the bakery wanting to buy cheesecake. With that encouragement, I purchased a bakery case and began to conduct retail business. Soon after our cheesecake attracted the press and we were listed in \"Best Bites\" in New York Magazine. Radio station WOR rated us \"Number One Cheesecake\" and we appeared on television quite often whipping up batters of cheesecake. Time passed, and now Cleveland Place is in a popular area where the mix of people and restaurants and shops are so unique. Downtown is becoming the \"place to be\", and we are actually on most maps now. We survived difficult times, and now \"let the good times roll\"!.

A brife desciction includes We founded Zeeks under the simple premise that pizza should be flavorful, not just cheap and fast. Don’t get us wrong; we like fast and reasonably priced, but cheap can suck it. To be driven by flavor, you need to care about things like what kind of flour and cheese you’re using and know where it’s coming from and how it’s handled. You need to do things like chop your herbs fresh every day. You need to wake up early and make dough every morning. You need to hand-toss and make every pizza to order. Your pizza needs to be baked by real humans in real ovens. It needs to get to your table or door before it’s done steaming. Basically, real food made with real love results in real flavor. Got it?.

            "The third limb of yoga is know as Asana.  This refers to the physical practice of yoga, or the yoga postures.  By putting the body into difficult positions you achieve several key benefits. The first is you are helping your body heal pain.  If you want to meditate and work on healing your mind, you need to first heal your body.  Otherwise your easily distracted mind will focus on pain in your body versus the pain in your mind.  Secondly, commitment to the Asana will teach you the discipline your mind needs to heal.  When going into uncomfortable situations, bad patterns in the mind often arise.  Stepping into discomfort actually becomes an opportunity to study the mind and change patterns of response.\n"
